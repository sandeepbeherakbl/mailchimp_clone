## About Us
In the course of the fifth unit here at Masai School, we learned about React and Redux

At the end of our fifth unit, we were given a project as a part of our curriculum. We are assigned a website to clone as a construct week project. In this project we have to use all the skills we have learned till now. I had to clone [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).
